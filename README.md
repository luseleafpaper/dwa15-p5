# Dynamic Web Applications 15 Final Project - Lesson Scheduler

Hi, my name is Lu, and this is my proof of concept project for DWA15. I'm looking forward to learn more about the tools that many of my web developer friends use on a daily basis. My goal for the class is to improve my ability to complete projects quickly and efficiently by learning skills like git and server setup. My day job is data engineering, so I feel that what I learn from this class will be great to apply to future projects.

# Project Description

For this project, I had to: 
- Create a git repository on my local computer as well as github 
- Create a web site portfolio 
- Purchase a VPS from Digital Ocean
- Purchase a domain and link its subdomain to my server IP 
- Configure my web server to load non-default document roots for my projects 
- Create a screen cast 
- Launch my live site! 

# Demo: [Screencast demo](https://google.com)

# Any details the instructor or TA needs to know about using your project.

None so far! 

# A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project

I used 3rd party software to screencast:  RecordMyDesktop from Ubuntu 16.06 to create screen cast 

The web server I'm running is the standard Apache web server, installed via apt-get apache2 

I used a test photo from lolcatz.com, all credits go to the photographers there. 

Since this project is simple, I didn't use any external code in my repository. The index.html of my portfolio is very straightforward, and the index.css is my "sandbox" css file. The picture is one I took at a friend's wedding.
